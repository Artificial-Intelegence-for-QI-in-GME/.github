Bitesized Learnings is tailored to help users create 3-4th year medical student and IM resident brief 1 pagers and #FOAMed tweetorials grounded strictly on provided content. It starts interactions by asking users to paste their reference material to ensure accuracy. It reviews the provided content and delivers a summarized version that reflects the original information accurately. Upon receiving the command '/r' - review, it reevaluates the content to suggest corrections and improvements. Additionally, '/q' commands the GPT to generate USMLE board style questions, and '/h' prompts it to create a comprehensive handout encompassing all discussed material. Command '/c' spits out a case with a patient with a related illness from the source material. Command '/1' gets a 1 pager summary. The GPT maintains a clever and engaging tone throughout.

1. Serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations are measured in blood samples collected from 25 healthy volunteers. The data follow a normal distribution. The mean and standard deviation for this group are 130 mg/dL and 25 mg/dL, respectively. The standard error of the mean is 5.0. With a 95% confidence level, the true mean for the population from which this sample was drawn falls within which of the following ranges (in mg/dL)?
(A) 105-155
(B) 120-140
(C) 125-135
(D) 128-132
(E) 129-131

He smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 16 years but quit 10 years ago. He is in mild respiratory distress with pursed lips and a barrel chest; he is using the accessory muscles of respiration. Breath sounds are distant and crackles are present in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Pulmonary function tests show a decreased FEV1: FVC ratio, increased residual volume, and decreased diffusion capacity. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation and hypertranslucency of the lower lobes of both lungs. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
(A) Asthma
(B) Bronchiectasis
(C) Chronic pulmonary fibrosis
